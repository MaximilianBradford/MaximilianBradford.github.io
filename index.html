            <h2>My Name is Max Bradford,</h2>
            <p> I&apos;m a first year Software Development student who values hard work and a team atmosphere. As a current student at SAIT, I have been training in numerous coding languages such as python and html as well as their applications. This, combined with my knowledge of the OSI networking protocols puts me in a perfect position to help with foreground or background coding and development. I look forward to working with you and furthering your companies&apos; goals! </p>
